# VechainWalletKit Testing Strategy

## 🎯 **New Testing Approach**

We've adopted a fresh testing strategy that focuses on **adapter-based integration testing** and **user journey validation** rather than isolated unit testing of individual functions.

## 📋 **Testing Philosophy**

### **Focus Areas:**
1. **Adapter Integration** - Test complete workflows through the `SmartAccountAdapter` interface
2. **User Journeys** - Test real-world scenarios from authentication to transaction completion  
3. **Smart Account Lifecycles** - Test deployment, versioning, and state transitions
4. **Error Handling** - Test failure scenarios and recovery patterns

### **Why This Approach?**
- ✅ **Tests Real User Flows** - Validates actual usage patterns
- ✅ **Adapter Pattern Alignment** - Tests match the new architecture
- ✅ **Integration Focus** - Catches issues between components
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Less brittle than deep unit tests

## 🗂️ **Test Structure**

```
__tests__/
├── adapters/
│   └── PrivySmartAccountAdapter.test.ts    # Core adapter functionality
├── journeys/
│   └── SmartAccountUserJourney.test.ts     # End-to-end user flows
├── scenarios/
│   └── SmartAccountLifecycle.test.ts       # Lifecycle and state testing
└── setup.ts                               # Test utilities and mocks
```

## 🎭 **Mocking Strategy**

We mock at the **boundary level** (Privy SDK, VeChain SDK) rather than internal functions:

- ✅ Mock `@privy-io/expo` hooks
- ✅ Mock `@vechain/sdk-core` utilities  
- ✅ Mock external provider requests
- ❌ Don't mock internal adapter methods
