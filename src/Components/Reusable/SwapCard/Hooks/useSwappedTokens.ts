/**
 * Custom React hook to fetch and set the details for paid and received tokens in a token swap operation.
 *
 * @param receivedTokenAddress - The address of the token to be received in the swap operation.
 * @param paidTokenAddress - The address of the token to be paid in the swap operation.
 *
 * @returns An object containing:
 * - paidToken: The FungibleToken object for the paid token, or undefined if not yet set or not found.
 * - receivedToken: The FungibleToken object for the received token, or undefined if not yet set or not found.
 * - tokens: An array of all available Token objects, fetched from the Redux store.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This hook uses the useThor and useAppSelector hooks from the application's components and Redux store, respectively.
 * If the token addresses given correspond to the VeChain token (VET), the hook will automatically use the details
 * for VET fetched from the Redux store. Otherwise, it attempts to find the token in the list of all tokens, and if not found,
 * it fetches the token info using the getCustomTokenInfo utility function.
