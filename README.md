# E2E

This project uses Maestro for E2E tests. Read more [here](https://maestro.mobile.dev/)(https://maestro.mobile.dev/cli/cloud)
Simple setup. Maestro is a single binary that works anywhere.

Step 1: Install Maestro
To get started with Maestro, install it using the following command:
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash

To upgrade the Maestro CLI:
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash

Step 2: Prepare the Environment

On the `.env.local` file, paste this two lines and replace `<e2e_mnemonic>` with your mnemonic

```bash
# maestro test
IS_CI_BUILD_ENABLED="true"
E2E_MNEMONIC="<e2e_mnemonic>"
```

#### Android Emulator Setup

Step 1: Prepare the Environment

1. Navigate to your platform tools directory:
   cd `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools`

2. Install adb

3. Open Android Studio

4. Start an emulator
   ./adb devices
   You should see an emulator listed.

Step 2: Generate and Install the APK

1. Generate the APK Locally:
   yarn purge
   yarn install:all
   yarn e2e.android.build.d

2. Start the Metro builder:
   yarn start:test

3. Install the APK on the emulator:
   ./adb -s emulator-5554 install ../veworld-mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

Step 3: Execute Tests
Run the flow.yaml file to start the test:
maestro test .maestro (This command looks for the config file in the .maestro folder and picks the flows for execution.)

Uninstall the App (if needed):
./adb -s <emulator_id> uninstall org.vechain.veworld.app

#### iOS emulator Setup

Step 1: Prepare the Environment

1.  List iOS devices:
    xcrun simctl list (List of ios devices with device ids)

2.  Boot an iOS device:
    xcrun simctl boot <device_id>

Step 2: Generate and Install the App

1. Generate the iOS App Locally:
   yarn purge
   yarn install:all
   yarn e2e.ios.build.d

2. Start the Metro builder:
   yarn start:test

3. Install the App:
   xcrun simctl install <device_id> <ios_app_location>

Step 3: Execute Tests

1. Run tests:
   maestro test .maestro

2. Uninstall the App (if needed):
   xcrun simctl uninstall <device_id> org.vechain.veworld.app

For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the Maestro documentation(https://maestro.mobile.dev/)


# Deployments
The deployment process is automated for both Andorid and iOS.
Every evening release-overnight.yaml is ran to check if there was any new PRs merged into main in the past day if so then the release process is kicked off for both operating systems. The release artifacts are then uploaded to the relevant app stores ready for testing and further release to end users.
