## EncryptedStorageContext

- EncryptedStorageContext - Leverage `WALLET_STATUS` instead of `WalletStauts`
- ~~Decrypting Wallets -> Probably big changes here, signing not tested yet~~
    - Tested sending simple transaction - works ok
    - Need to do more tests. Certificates, delegation, etc.
- Create a standalone unlock screen for pincodes. See `TODO`s in `EncryptedStorageContext`
- Unify Wallets and Redux Keys
    - Currently, wallets and redux encryption keys and both encrypted with the pincodes and stored separately. This can
      lead to problems if we update the pincode, as we have to perform updates in 2 places.
- Update Pin Code (Security Settings)
- Switch Bio to PIN (Security Settings)
- Switch PIN to Bio (Security Settings)
- `userPreferences` should not be encrypted so we can access it on the unlock screen.
- Unlock with biometrics -> prompted multiple times. The following point may help
- `SecurityProvider` should probably get removed now, since all security is handled by root Provider
- `PinCodeProvider` can probably get removed now as well
- `useAppReset` -> navigate to Welcome screen on reset
- Need to fix the NFT Slice. See this
  commit: https://github.com/vechainfoundation/veworld-mobile/commit/33f6fc6ab4ad7d3b29727e04f92368e7e1b07c62
- Remove old app data. It can be constructed by:

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new MMKV instance with the given Configuration. If no custom id is supplied, 'mmkv.default' will be used.
 */
const OldAppStorage = new MMKV({ id: "mmkv.default" }) 
```
